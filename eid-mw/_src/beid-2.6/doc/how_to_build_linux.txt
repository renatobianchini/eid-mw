Assumptions:
------------
All necessary libraries are installed on the build machine: (see also project eID MW 3.X documentation)

- Qt 3
- wxGTK2.6 and 2.4
- jdk 1.4.2
- g++
- gcc
- make
- ...


General
-------
The build procedures on linux are tested on the following distributions:

- fedora 9
- debian 4.0 etch
- openSuSE 11

The build of the complete project is only working on debian etch. The other linux distributions
build all libraries except the GUI.

Functionally nothing is changed in the source code. Only some minor changes in the sources have been done
such that the code compiles without problems on the different linux platforms.

Basic changes are:
- a new root certificate is hardcoded
- compiler/linker specific stuff (like system include files, const,..)
- hard coded path to global configuration file
- version nr of libbeid.so is changed to 2.8.0


Build procedure
---------------
- on fedora 9:
  cd /usr/bin
  ln -s wx-2.6-config wx-config
- create a directory: ~/projects
- cd projects
- svn checkout http://10.2.250.30/svn/eidmw/trunk/beid2.6 beid-2.6
- chmod +x configure
- check that the file build_environment_<distribution>.source contains the correct settings
  and change if necessry
- source build_environment_<distribution>.source
- ./configure
- make


This procedure should build all necessary .so files except the GUI:

src/newpkcs11/src/pkcs11/libbeidpkcs11.so
src/newpkcs11/src/pkcs11/libbeidlibopensc.so
src/winscarp/libbeidpcsclite.so
src/beidcommon/libbeidcommon.so
src/beidcommlib/libbeidcomm.so
src/eidlib/libbeid.so
src/belpicgui/libbeidgui.so
src/eidlibjni/libbeidlibjni.so
