This is the CSP generated by ..\beidcsp.vcproj.
It has been signed by Microsoft.

However, what this CSP does is call the corresponding
function of the CSPlib generated by ..\..\beidcsp.vcproj.

E.g. the CSP function CPAcquireContext() in beidCSP.dll
calls the function eidmwAcquireContext() in beidCSPlib.dll.

The reason is that we can modify the CSP behaviour (in
the CSP lib) without have to modify _and sign_ the CSP;
which is very usefull for testing (without having to wait
1 to 3 days to have each modification signed again.)

Because this beidCSP.dll can't be build (because then
the signature gets lost), and because normally it never
has to be changed (because there's no functionality
inside, except calling the corresponding function in
the CSP lib), it's been put in SVN.
