Adding tests to the test suite
==============================

Since we want this test suite to function on all platforms, and since
adding another executable on some platforms is rather involved, there's
some added code which may make things seem slightly convoluted. It's not
too hard, however.

To add a test `foo` to the test suite, take the following steps:
- Implement a function `foo`, but use the TEST_FUNC macro for this.
- Edit `testlib.h`, add a line `int foo();` (function declaration)
- Edit Makefile.am, adding `foo` to the `TESTS` variable, and adding lines
  `foo_SOURCES` and `foo_LDADD`. The `foo_SOURCES` variable should reference
  the file where you wrote your function `foo`, the foo_LDADD can be copied
  from most of the others (some tests, like the "sign" and "decode_photo"
  tests, require more libraries, so you should avoid those).
- Change the Windows and OSX project files so that the file `foo.c` is now also
  compiled.

You're done!
