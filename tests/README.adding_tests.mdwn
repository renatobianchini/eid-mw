Adding tests to the test suite
==============================

Since we want this test suite to function on all platforms, and since
adding another executable on some platforms is rather involved, there's
some added code which may make things seem slightly convoluted. It's not
too hard, however.

To add a test `foo` to the test suite, take the following steps:
- Implement a function `foo` "somewhere". This would preferably be done in its
  own file (`foo.c`), but that isn't _strictly_ necessary.
- Edit `testlib.h`:
    - add a constant `TEST_FOO` with value `1 << X`, with `X` being the first
      value not yet used.
    - increment the value of `TESTS_COUNT`
    - add a line `int foo();` (function declaration)
- Edit the `init_tests()` function in testlib.c, adding a stanza for your new
  test.
- Edit Makefile.am, adding `foo` to the `TESTS` variable, and adding lines
  `foo_SOURCES`, `foo_LDADD` and `foo_CPPFLAGS`. The `foo_SOURCES` should
  reference the file where you wrote your function `foo`.
- Change the Windows and OSX project files so that the file `foo.c` is now also
  compiled.

You're done!
