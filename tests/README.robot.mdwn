Robot handling
==============

The test suite has support for a "robot", which allows the test suite to
insert a card into the card reader, remove it, enter a pin code, or
confirm access to the card for privacy-sensitive data.

To select the robot type to use, set the `EID_ROBOT_STYLE` environment
variable to the correct value. We foresee the following possibilities:

1. `EID_ROBOT_STYLE=manual`: no actual robot, instead print instructions
   on stdout and ask the user to perform actions. For interactive use
   only. This robot style assumes that the PIN code is known and that
   read access to privacy-sensitive data will be granted.
2. `EID_ROBOT_STYLE=`_path to unix domain socket_: a robot listens on
   the unix domain socket to commands. Not yet implemented. This robot
   may or may not have the ability to specify a pin code or confirm
   access; whether this is the case will be specified through other
   `EID_*` environment variables.
3. `EID_ROBOT_STYLE` is unset: no robot is available; tests which
   require the insertion or removal of a card will be skipped, as will
   tests which require entering the PIN code or confirming access to
   privacy-sensitive data.

In addition, most tests require an actual card to be in a reader. This
may be a test card, or it can be an actual ID card. It is safe to run
the test suite on all current cards; the test suite will only read data
from the card, never write to it.
