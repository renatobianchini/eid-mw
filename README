beid MiddleWare installation
----------------------------

I. Code from svn repository:
============================

- Make sure you have libtool 2.2.7c or above, autoconf and automake installed, and in your $PATH
- run autoreconf -i 
- proceed to II.

II. Code from a source package, or code you just bootstrapped at item I.
========================================================================

a) GNU/Linux
------------

- Make sure you have pcsc-lite and gtk2 and and their development libraries installed
  after that it's just:

  	./configure 
  	make
 	sudo make install

You should now have beid* libraries in /usr/local/lib and one beid* executable in /usr/local/bin

At runtime, you will need a running pcsc daemon ("pcscd") with the correct driver for your type of card reader
(ccid drivers are generally installed automatically along with the pcscd package)

b) OSX
------

- Make sure you have the Qt and pcsc-lite frameworks installed

  /Library/Frameworks/{QtCore,QtGui,PCSC}.Framework

(TODO: complete these instructions)

c) MS Windows: TODO: Write README chapter

d) Dialogs
----------
Pin dialogs can be disabled eg for applications that have their own dialogs:

 ./configure --enable-dialogs=no # the default is yes

e) Firefox
----------

To use the Belgian eID in Firefox, we recommend the Firefox extension to handle configuration automatically. 
The extension will be installed on Linux and OSX. The default install locations:
- Linux: DATADIR/mozilla/extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}
	(DATADIR is by default PREFIXDIR/lib - PREFIXDIR is by default /usr/local)
- OSX: /Library/Application Support/Mozilla/Extensions/{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}

To change the install location:
 
 ./configure --with-mozext=/mozilla/firefox/extensions/directory

To create an XPI package, run:
 
  make xpipackage
