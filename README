beid MiddleWare installation
----------------------------

I. Code from svn repository:
============================

- Make sure you have libtool 2.2.7c or above, autoconf and automake installed, and in your $PATH
- run autoreconf -i 
- proceed to II.

II. Code from a source package, or code you just bootstrapped at item I.
========================================================================

a) GNU/Linux
------------

- Make sure you have Qt SDK, pcsc-lite and OpenSSL installed.

- ./configure --with-qt=<QT_INSTALL_DIR> --with-pcsclite=<PCSCLITE_INSTALL_DIR> --with-openssl=<OPENSSL_INSTALL_DIR>

  for example, on my Arch 64 system, I built a Qt and installed it in it's default location /usr/local/Trolltech/<version>, 
  and I installed pcsc-lite and openssl using Arch's package manager, putting them in /usr/include and /usr/lib, so my configure
  command becomes:

  ./configure --with-qt=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.2/ --with-pcsclite=/usr --with-openssl=/usr

- make

- sudo make install

You should now have beid* libraries in /usr/local/lib and one beid* executable in /usr/local/bin

At runtime, you will need a running pcsc daemon ("pcscd") with the correct driver for your type of card reader
(ccid drivers are generally installed automatically along with the pcscd package)

We recommend you use our Firefox plugin to handle configuration of Firefox automatically. It's called "Belgium eID" and is available
from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox

b) OSX
------

- Make sure you have the Qt and pcsc-lite frameworks installed

  /Library/Frameworks/{QtCore,QtGui,PCSC}.Framework

(TODO: complete these instructions)


b) 32-bit MS Windows
--------------------

- Make sure you have the appropriate toolchain installed. We use MinGW-w64 to build on Windows.

- Make sure the decorated tools from your toolchain are on your PATH.

- Run ./configure --host=<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN_TRIGRAM>
  for example, we would use:

  ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32

- make

- make install
