beid MiddleWare installation
----------------------------

I. Code from svn repository:
----------------------------

- Make sure you have libtool, autoconf and automake installed.
- run ./bootstrap in the middleware directory
- proceed to II.

II. Code from a source package, or code you just bootstrapped at item I.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) GNU/Linux

- Make sure you have Qt SDK and pcsc-lite installed.

- cd to the middleware directory

- Run ./configure --with-qt=<QT_INSTALL_DIR> --with-pcsclite=<PCSCLITE_INSTALL_DIR>
  for example, on my Arch 64 system, I built a Qt and installed it in it's default location /usr/local/Trolltech, 
  and I installed pcsc-lite using Arch's package manager, putting it in /usr/include and /usr/lib, so my configure
  command becomes:

  ./configure --with-qt=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.2/ --with-pcsclite=/usr

- make
  note: you may benefit from using the -j option, followed by a number slightly greater than the number of cores in your system.
  For example, on our 8-core system, I use make -j12 to build the entire middleware from scratch in about 40 seconds.

- as root: make install

b) 32-bit MS Windows

- Make sure you have the appropriate Cross-Compiling toolchain installed. We use MinGW-w64 to build on Windows.q

- Make sure the decorated tools from your Cross-Compiling toolchain are on your PATH.

- cd to the middleware directory

- Run ./configure --host=<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN_TRIGRAM>
  for example, we would use:

  ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32

- make
  note: you may benefit from using the -j option, followed by a number slightly greater than the number of cores in your system.
  For example, on our 8-core system, I use make -j12 to build the entire middleware from scratch in slightly over one minute.
